# Machine Learning 382 - GroupF CYO Project
## **Overview:**
This project is a comprehensive study aimed at **building a predictive model to assess the creditworthiness of individuals or businesses**. The purpose of this project is to predict the risk of default on loans or credit lines, which is a critical aspect of financial risk assessment.

The project utilizes a dataset titled “Credit Risk Assessment” authored by Urvish Vekariya and sourced from Kaggle. The dataset will undergo a series of data analysis and preprocessing steps, including dataset analysis, univariate and bi-variate analysis, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and outlier value handling. Two models will be built and their predictions will be evaluated. The feature importance from each model will be analyzed and the models will be saved as pickle files for future use. The second model will undergo additional cross-validation to ensure its robustness.

Finally, the validated model will be deployed as a server in a web application using DASH, providing a practical interface for credit risk assessment. This project is a significant step towards leveraging machine learning for effective and efficient credit risk management. It aims to provide a reliable tool for financial institutions to make informed decisions regarding loan approvals and credit line extensions.
