    - The attribute names are inconsistent and will need standardizing in the data processing section.
    - Feature Variable (Independent variable): This variable stands alone and is not changed by other variables that are being measured. It is denoted as X in ML algorithms.
    - Target Variable (Dependent variable): This is the variable that is to be predicted. It is often denoted as Y in ML algorithms.
    - In both datasets there are 10 feature variables but only the raw_data dataset has 1 target variable.
    - The target variable in the raw_data dataset is the loan_status attribute.
    - This variable will be predicted using models for the validation_data dataset.

    - There is a discrepancy between the two datasets: the "person_emp_length" attribute is of datatype float64 in the raw_data.csv file but of datatype object in the validation_data.csv file. 
    - This could lead to potentially issues when modeling, as the model might be expecting the same data type for a given attribute.
    - This discrepancy will need to be fixed in the data processing section.
